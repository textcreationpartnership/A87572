         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Lord <hi>Strange</hi> (now Earle of <hi>Derbie</hi>) is the great Ring-leader of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh faction and Malignant partie, and keepes his <hi>Randevouz</hi> at <hi>Warrington,</hi> whither great multitudes of ill-affected people, both out of <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> and <hi>Cheſhire</hi> doe daily reſort, it lying upon the fronters of both. They make daily great ſpoyle in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which hath now awakned them of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and ſo incenſed them, that they are tide death tide life reſolved to indure it no longer, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare

               <!-- PDF PAGE 12 -->by the laſt Skirmiſh that this laſt week fell out at <hi>Leigh</hi> and <hi>Loaton</hi> Common, between the Earle of <hi>Derbies</hi> Troopes and the Countrey people, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I my ſelfe being one, can relate you the truth: for the laſt Sabbath as wee were going towards the Church, a Poſt rode through the Countrey, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming us that the Earles Troopes were comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Chow-bent;</hi> whereupon the Countrey pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently roſe, and before one of the Clocke on that day we were gathered together about 3000. Horſe and Foote, Incountring them at <hi>Chow-bent</hi> aforeſaid, and beate them backe to <hi>Leigh,</hi> killing ſome and wounding many. Where you would wonder to have ſcene the forwardneſſe of the young youths, Farmers ſonnes, who indeed were two forward, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had little experience of the like times before this. And ſo We over-road our Foote, being carried with a fervent deſire to overtake them, and to doe ſome notable Service upon them, ſo that we drove them to <hi>Loaton</hi>-Common, where they knowing our foote to be far behinde, turned faces about and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make head againſt us. Whereupon began a ſharpe although a ſhort Incounter, but when they perceived our full and ſetled reſolution, they made away as faſt as their Horſes could carry them, and we after them, killing, wounding, and taking priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156285:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 12 -->about 200 of them; and we loſt never a man, onely we had three of our men wounded, but not mortally, ſo that I thinke they will trouble us no more out of that part of the Countrey, but if they doe we ſhall be better provided for them then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for we are all upon our Guard, and the Naylers of <hi>Chow-bent,</hi> inſtead of making nayles, have buſied themſelves in making of Bills and Battle-Axes; and alſo this weeek the other part of the Countrey meet and intend not onely to ſtand upon their Guard, but to diſarme all the Papiſts and Malignants within their Precincts, which wee are reſolved upon in our Precincts, and alſo by Gods aſſiſtance to take the greateſt Papiſts and moſt dangerous Malignants priſoners, and carry them to <hi>Mancheſter</hi> to keepe houſe with Sir <hi>Cecill Traffard,</hi> that Arch-Papiſt, who is there a priſoner; for now the men of <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne, Paduam, Burnely, Clitherc,</hi> and <hi>Colme,</hi> with thoſe ſturdy Churles in the two forreſts of <hi>Pendle</hi> and <hi>Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſendale,</hi> have raiſed their Spirits, and are reſolved to fight it out, rather then their Beefe and fatt Bacon ſhall be taken from them. For the laſt weeke Sir <hi>Gilbert Houghton</hi> ſet his Beacon on fire, which ſtood upon the top of <hi>Houghton</hi> Tower, and was the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall to the Countrey for the Papiſts and Malignants to ariſe in the field, and in <hi>Lealand</hi> hundreth; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

               <!-- PDF PAGE 13 -->upon great multitudes accordingly reſorted to him to <hi>Preſton</hi> in <hi>Anderneſſe,</hi> and ran to <hi>Blackburne,</hi> and ſo through the Countrey, diſarming all, and pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſome, which Maſter <hi>Shuttlewath,</hi> a Parliament man, and Maſter <hi>Starkie</hi> hearing of, preſently had gotten together out of the places formerly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about 8000. men, met with Sir <hi>Gilbert</hi> and his Catholique Malignants at <hi>Hinfield</hi>-moore, put them to flight, tooke away many of their Armes, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued Sir <hi>Gilbert</hi> ſo hotly, that he quit his horſe, leapt into a field, and by the comming on of the night eſcaped through fur-buſhes and by-wayes to <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> and there makes great defence by chaining up <hi>Ribble</hi>-bridge, and getting what force he can into the Towne for his ſecuritie: out of which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey ſweares they will have him by Gods helpe, with all his adherents, either quicke or dead; ſo that by the next Poſt, I hope, I ſhall certifie of ſome good poſture that the Countrey will be in. O that the Parliament had but ſent downe their 1000. of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooneers into the Countrey, wee would not have left a Maſſe monger, nor Malignant of note, but we would have provided a lodging for him.</p>
            <p>It is reported by ſome about the Earle of <hi>Derbie,</hi> that he is very melancholy, and much perplexed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that unadviſed courſe that he hath run, for the

            <p>This day came Newes from <hi>Yorke,</hi> that it is in great diſtreſſe for victuals, ſo that the Citizens, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the women, ſweare if my Lord of <hi>Cumberland</hi> will not be gone, they will try their skill to ſet him packing.
